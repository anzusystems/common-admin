# Nodes

If you think of the document as a tree, then nodes are just a type of content in that tree. Examples of nodes are paragraphs, headings, or code blocks. Nodes are mostly blocks, but nodes donâ€™t have to be blocks. They can also be rendered inline with the text.

## Embeds
- all nodes starting with `embed...` follow same pattern
- example for `embedPoll` schema:

```json
{
  "name": "embedPoll",
  "groups": [
    "embed"
  ],
  "attrs": {
    "id": {
      "default": "" // string (uuid of embed)
    },
    "changeId": {
      "default": "" // string (uuid of last change made by user - needed for collaboration)
    }
  }
}
```
- example for `embedPoll` data json:

```json
{
  "type": "embedPoll",
  "attrs": {
    "id": "ae0a44d6-4c9b-40f8-b44f-30d978cd93fb",
    "changeId": "75f63c30-168f-11ee-b9a4-edda1c3364ed"
  }
}
```
- so in editor embeds are just placeholders where the embed should be rendered
- all other data for embed are provided by API

## Notes

- embedAudio, embedVideo, embedNewsletter are still WIP
