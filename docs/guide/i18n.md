# i18n

## For product owner/translators
- you can find translations in `src/locales/[lang]` in common-admin and all admins too
- if you need a new language to use in admin, you must also add this language to common admin if needed

## For developer
- i18n instance is created and exported by common-admin
- language translations are lazy loaded on app load or on language switch
- common admin must contain translation for all languages used in admins
- translations are merged to this object:

```ts
export default {
  common: {
    component1,
    component2,
    entity1,
    entity2,
    // and more
  },
  $vuetify: vuetify,
  error: {
    apiValidation: {
      ...apiValidation,
    },
    apiForbiddenOperation: {
      ...apiForbiddenOperation,
    },
    jsValidation: {
      ...jsValidation,
    },
  },
}
```

#### error
- errors consist of `apiValidation`, `apiForbiddenOperation` and `jsValidation`
- `apiValidation`: anzu API can return validation error response with specific format containing keys that needs to be translated for user
- `apiForbiddenOperation`: same as above but for forbidden error response
- `jsValidation`: custom validation texts used by vuelidate and js validation inside vue app

#### $vuetify
- custom modified translations for vuetify components

#### common
- all translations used by common admin components or really commonly reused translation are all prefixed by `common.xxx...`
::: warning
Do not add new root object keys to translations, put all new translation in `common` key so its clear it's for common admin. If you really need it, consult it with team and update docs.
:::

  
- translation texts are then exported for each language, so you can import only needed languages in admin
- in admin, you need to merge some translation, so it will contain messages used by common admin and admin messages, example:
```ts
import { messagesSk } from '@anzusystems/common-admin'

export default {
  common: messagesSk.common,
  $vuetify: messagesSk.$vuetify,
  cms: {
    site,
    job,
    article,
    rubric,
    // and more
  },
  sidebar,
  breadcrumb,
  system,
  ...{
    error: {
      apiValidation: {
        ...messagesSk.error.apiValidation,
        ...apiValidation,
      },
      apiForbiddenOperation: {
        ...messagesSk.error.apiForbiddenOperation,
        ...apiForbiddenOperation,
      },
      jsValidation: {
        ...messagesSk.error.jsValidation,
        ...jsValidation,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

### Anzu api entities
As anzu api work with specific response formats, in admins follow these rules:
- always put translation to system key:
```ts
cms: {
  site,
  job,
  article,
  rubric
  // and more
}
weather: {
  location,
  locationGroup  
  // etc
}
```
- inside of translation, always put entity fields inside of `model` key and filters inside of `filter` key, because validation errors are translated using this structure, example:
```json
{
  "filter": {
    "id": "Id",
    "title": "Title"
  },
  "model": {
    "id": "Id",
    "title": "Title",
    "domain": "Domain"
  }
}
```
- other fields are mostly up to you, but try to check and follow existing translations in admins


### More examples
- for better example check any admin with implemented common admin
